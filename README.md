# gitscroll
Those times that you have code on a website.

You have html, words and code.

Right now, there's a lot of copying and pasting. It's dumb. What should happen is hidden git style diffs/commits should be under the page

Then, as you scroll past changes in code or words, there are commits backing up the changes.

At any point through the scroll, you should be able to grab a commit hash corresponding to the download link or repo commit view (probably on github).
